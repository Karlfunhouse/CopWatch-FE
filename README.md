# CopWatch-FE

### Abstract
CopWatch is dedicated to providing civilians with a fast and easy way to document incidents of police misconduct.  Given the current climate of social unrest and widespread protests against police brutality specifically against marginalized populations, we wanted to provide citizens with a tool to catalogue police interactions in one consolidated place.  We are calling for police accountability now.
